#
# This workflow is to show how you can start a long-running background process and
# continue on to additional steps, with different strategies.
#
# The main use case is for integration test scenarios, where you want to do something
# like this:
# - run: npm run start # but background it
# - run: npm run wait-for-server
# - run: npm run integration-tests
#
# If you want you can fully background the running script using the & character, for
# example `- run: npm run start &` but if it crashes along the way, you might not get the
# errors printed out in a useful way, and the step won't be marked as failing.
