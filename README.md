# workflow-demos

A library of different things you can do with Github Workflows, meant as a resource for myself and to share with others.

## Organization

The [`scripts` folder](./scripts) has JavaScript files that are used by the Workflow Actions to simulate things, like running an HTTP server.

The [`workflows` folder](./workflows) has YAML files that are fully commented with what they do.

## Contributing

Feel free to make a pull request with corrections, or to suggest new things!

Note that the Workflow YAML files should **not** be in the normal `.github/workflows` folder, because then they might run in this repository!

## License

All files and comments are published and released under the [Very Open License](http://veryopenlicense.com).
